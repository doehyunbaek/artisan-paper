In summary, this paper contributes the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SERE-Bench, a novel benchmark that evaluates the capabilities of AI agents to reproduce Software Engineering papers using script submission.
    \item Artisan, an LLM-based approach which incorporates several tools to aid the reproduction of software engineering research artifacts.
    \item Empirical evaluation which shows that (1) SERE-Bench is challenging for the current state of the art LLM agents and (2) Artisan effectively addresses the common pitfalls faced by LLM agents.
\end{itemize}
